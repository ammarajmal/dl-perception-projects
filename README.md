# Deep Learning Perception Projects

This repository showcases real-world perception systems built with deep learning.
Focus: computer vision for smart cities, robotics, and infrastructure monitoring.

## Projects

### 1. Traffic & People Detection 🚧 *In Progress*
Real-time detection and counting system using transfer learning.

- Problem: Understanding people/traffic flow for smart cities
- Approach: Pretrained deep learning model + video analytics
- Tech Stack: Python, TensorFlow/PyTorch, OpenCV

See: [traffic_people_detection](./traffic_people_detection/)

## Future Directions
